IOT based Children tracking and Security System provides security to children and gives
update regarding this to their parents. This system will be able to track live location of children,
children can communicate with their parents. This system will also include health parameters
like heartbeats monitoring and using GPS, GSM parents will get updates of this all on their
mobile phones. In this system, GPS will track longitude and latitude of location and when
parent wants to know the current location of their ward, parents can send message as “send
location” to GSM registered mobile number, then parents will get message on mobile phones
about current location of ward. When parents wants to track health parameters of their
children, then parents can send message on children GSM number like “send pulse rate”, this
message reached the system and after processing system will revert back to parents with current
heart rate data of children. If someone tries to trouble the child, they are provided with SoS
button, children can press that in case of emergencies to send emergency notification such as
pulse rate and location to parents.
